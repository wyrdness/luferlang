      "summary": "An impossibly enormous creature so large it is mistaken for a landscape feature such as a hill or mountain ridge.",
      "full": "The Luferlang is one of the most extreme fearsome critters in terms of scale. This creature is so monumentally enormous that observers mistake it for part of the landscape itself—what appears to be a hill or mountain ridge is actually the sleeping Luferlang. According to lumberjack tall tales, the creature is so vast that it takes days to walk around it, and its breathing creates wind patterns. Trees grow on its back, and entire ecosystems exist on its body without the creature noticing. The Luferlang represents the fearsome critter tradition's love of exaggeration taken to its logical extreme: a creature so large it transcends being an animal and becomes geography."
